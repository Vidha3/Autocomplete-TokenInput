=======================================================

Original source: https://loopj.com/jquery-tokeninput/

Overview
--------
- Tokeninput is a jQuery plugin which allows your users to select multiple items from a predefined list, using autocompletion as they type to find each item.
- This plugin was modified to work for the OMDB API: http://www.omdbapi.com/
- This feature allows the user to search for a movie by its title, and provides suggestions closest to the entered characters, listing the movie title along with the director.
- The selected movie gets loaded in the search bar as a token (or pill), with a delete (x) option
- No more than 5 selections can be made at a time
- The autocomplete section is lost when clocked outside of the box
